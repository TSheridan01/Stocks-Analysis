# Stocks-Analysis

1)	####Overview: 

The overview of this project was to provide a way for my client, Steve to show his parents more stock data in a faster more efficient method.
The challenge was to create a way to loop through the data faster in order to pull data from a larger number of stocks. I was able to improve the logic in order to make the code easier to read and to make it simpler on future collaborators. The code will help Steve and his parents make more sound financial decisions.

##2017 vs. 2018 

Steve's stocks would of returned a higher yield in 2017. He should of not invested in 2018.

#What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring code does not affect what the code does, but it does create a code that is easier to follow, adjust, edit and collaborate on. After code is refactored, it should be more efficient and take up less memory and be easier to go into later on and adjust as needed when the project is not as fresh in your mind. An advantage is that it optimizes the code without changing the performance of the code. A disadvantage of refactoring is that it may take longer to adjust an already completed project and ultimately time is money for corporations and clients and they may not understand the value of fixing something that already works. If a collaborator refactors your code, they may not understand the logic your using and adjust something that can impact a small portion of the code which can change the results. 

#How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The pro is that the code does run faster and can handle more data. The con was new variables had to be introduced and the time it took to read through the code over and over again in order to find all my bugs and work them out. The refactored script takes up more memory since it includes three new arrays but it is much faster. The refactored code ran in 0.105 Seconds for 2018 as opposed to 28.365 for the older script.
